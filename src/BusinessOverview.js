    <h1>Personalized Assistance for Independent Living</h1>
    <p>Ro on the Go, LLC., was formed out of a need I saw when taking care of my aging parents. I was one of four siblings and on certain days, we wished for a fifth sibling. Someone to help us out with doctor visits, take dad in for chemo treatments, or mom in for blood transfusions.
  In todayâ€™s society, families are spread far and wide, leaving individuals of all ages who are new to a community without a network of friends or family who can provide assistance. I would like to be part of your network in the Grand Island community.</p>
